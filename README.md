# PySMRS
An unsupervised compressed-sensing technique for fundamental objects selection

# Introduction

This is a python implementation of [(Ehsan Elhamifar et. al)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6247852/). They consider the problem of finding a few representatives for a dataset, (i.e., a subset of data points that efficiently describes the entire dataset). They experiment this techniques on data such as video ([Video Summarization](http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6930/Video-Summarization.html)) but other type of data may be considered for some experiment.


# Requirements

  - Python 2.7 or greater <br>
  - Opencv (facoltative)
  
# Usage

`git clone https://github.com/DavideNardone/PySMRS.git` <br>

`unzip PySMRS-master.py`

then... run one of the following demo:

`python demo.py (naive example)` <br>

`python demo_video.py` (computationally expensive)
